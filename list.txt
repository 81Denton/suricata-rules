"DO NOT USE!" categories moved here
-----------------------------------
emerging-botcc <<< use list
emerging-botcc.portgrouped <<< use list
emerging-ciarmy <<< use list
emerging-compromised <<< use list
emerging-drop <<< use list
emerging-dshield <<< use list
emerging-telnet <<< Telnet is bad for kittens. Please stop using it. If your multithousand $ networking device does not allow for ssh access to it, please slowly open the window and throw it as far away as you can. Then purchase a multidozen $ networking device that allows ssh access.
emerging-tftp > all rules in this category are based on port 69. Can be easily taken care of by firewall rules not allowing incoming/outgoing traffic for port 69 and a custom suricata rule. No need to waste processing here. Technically tftp has no place on the internet. >>>At least<<< set up a vpn/tunnel to encrypt the traffic, make sure who you are talking to is who you want to talk to.
emerging-tor <<< use a list for this
emerging-netbios <<< Accessing netbios over the internet is considered as being one of the 3 worst mistakes in your life. Please set up *at least* a vpn (ssh tunnel/normal vpn) if you are stubborn and still wish to make this mistake.
emerging-rbn-malvertisers <<< no longer maintained
emerging-rbn <<< no longer maintained
